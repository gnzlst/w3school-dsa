# Learn Data Structures and Algorithms

- Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) is a fundamental part of Computer Science that teaches you how to think and solve complex problems systematically.

- Using the right data structure and algorithm makes your program run faster, especially when working with lots of data.

- Knowing DSA can help you perform better in job interviews and land great jobs in tech companies.

## This Tutorial

- This tutorial is made to help you learn Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) fast and easy.

- First, you will learn the fundamentals of DSA: understanding different data structures, basic algorithm concepts, and how they are used in programming.

- Then, you will learn more about complex data structures like trees and graphs, study advanced sorting and searching algorithms, explore concepts like time complexity, and more.

- This tutorial will give you a solid foundation in Data Structures and Algorithms, an essential skill for any software developer.

Example

```python
my_array = [7, 12, 9, 4, 11]
minVal = my_array[0]

for i in my_array:
    if i < minVal:
        minVal = i

print('Lowest value:',minVal)
```

## What You Should Already Know

- Although Data Structures and Algorithms is actually not specific to any programming language, you should have a basic understanding of programming in one of these common programming languages:

>
    Python
    C
    C++
    Java
    JavaScript

# DSA History

- The word 'algorithm' comes from 'al-Khwarizmi', named after a Persian scholar who lived around year 800.

- The concept of algorithmic problem-solving can be traced back to ancient times, long before the invention of computers.

- The study of Data Structures and Algorithms really took off with the invention of computers in the 1940s, to efficiently manage and process data.

- Today, DSA is a key part of Computer Science education and professional programming, helping us to create faster and more powerful software.
